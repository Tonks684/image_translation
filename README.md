# Exercise 4: Image translation


## Get the terminal ready.
If the `(base)` prefix is not present in front of the shell prompt, you need to initialize conda and restart the terminal:
```
conda init bash
```

## Copy data and setup environment.
Open the terminal and run the shell script that fetches the data and the microDL repository.
```
bash setup_data_environment.sh 
```
## If working on a virtual desktop (e.g., NoMachine)

Launh jupyter lab from the terminal within your session:
```
jupyter lab
```

## If working on a terminal

Launch a jupyter lab server that you can connect from your browser: 

```
jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser
```

Then you can access your notebooks in your browser at:

```
http://<your server name>.compute.amazonaws.com:8888?<token generated by jupyter lab>
```

<your server name> is the host address you use to connect via ssh or nomachine, and *not the hostname displayed by jupyter lab in the terminal*. You do need to copy the token shown by the jupyter lab server in the terminal.

Open the notebook under /microDL/notebook/, and continue with the instructions in the notebook.
